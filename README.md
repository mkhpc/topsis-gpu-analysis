# TOPSIS Analysis of GPU Compute Instances for HPC and AI in the Cloud
This repository contains the code and data used for the research paper on evaluating GPU compute instances for HPC and AI across major cloud providers using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. The analysis includes sensitivity analysis, bootstrap analysis, and non-parametric tests to assess the robustness and reliability of the rankings. The repository provides Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and datasets necessary for reproducing the results and extending the study to other cloud computing scenarios.
